        ## TLDR on adding new devices

        - Often different models of same manufacturer / supplier (like EACHINE) have different protocols. 
        - It's worth trying with similar devices of same manufacturer first though.

        - Can you search [fccid site](https://fccid.io/company.php). Use company name. Usually it would find have few entries for same manufacturer. 
        Go through the devices & try to find your specific device.

        - `Advanced users` Can you disassemble device & take a look inside receiver & transmitter ? It would be useful to know what chip is used inside.

        - Can you take a photo of device / controller, paste them here, and do [google image search](https://images.google.com) for similar devices ?
